3D mapping
========

Disease genetic risk is fundamentally embeded within the native 3D cellular architecture of tissues. While 2D ST sections are informative, they capture only a partial view of spatial organization and may miss critical biological signals that span across sections. This limitation can lead to incomplete or even misleading interpretations of where disease-associated cells actually function.

gsMap 3D mapping (**gsMap3D**) is a comprehensive computational framework that addresses this gap by integrating (GWAS) with 3D-reconstructed ST data, enabling the discovery of the true spatial organization of disease risk.

This section provides tutorials for integrating GWAS with 3D ST datasets using gsMap.
