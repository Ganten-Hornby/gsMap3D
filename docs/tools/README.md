# Documentation tools

Run from the repository root after installing the documentation dependencies:

```bash
python -m docs.tools.generate_cli_reference
python -m docs.tools.generate_downloads --catalog docs/resource_catalog.json
sphinx-build -W --keep-going -b html docs/source docs/build/html
```

These tools generate public documentation only. The resource catalogue contains
public download metadata, not local source mappings or server configuration.
Tutorial checks live in `tests/helpers/`; see `tests/README.md`.

Regenerate the CPU and GPU scalability figures from the checked-in measurement
CSVs without running a new benchmark:

```bash
python -m docs.tools.plot_trait_scalability
python -m docs.tools.plot_scalability
```

`plot_trait_scalability` draws the IQ-only/four-trait CPU and GPU comparisons.
`plot_scalability` redraws the separate CPU batch-size sweep and the earlier
four-trait GPU sweep; the latter is retained as historical measurement data,
not mixed into the new curves. Both tools read local CSVs and need no GWAS files.

To import a new **complete, numerically validated** single-/four-trait sweep,
pass its results directory to `plot_trait_scalability --benchmark-root PATH`.
It requires all 72 measurements: CPU 1/2/4/8/16/32 cores (three repetitions),
and A100/V100/RTX 2080 Ti 1/2/4 GPUs (two repetitions), for both trait counts.
Both platforms must use the same 1,000,037 cells. CPU summaries are read from
`cpu/runs_million/`; GPU summaries from `gpu/scaling_results/`. Source and input
provenance must match across all summaries.
Incomplete or failed summaries cannot replace the public measurement CSV.

Measurement scope and provenance are recorded in
`docs/source/_static/benchmarks/README.md`. Do not mix different timing protocols
in a CPU-versus-GPU speedup comparison.
